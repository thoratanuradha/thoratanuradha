Objective:-
1)Importing the RandomForestClassifier,setting up the model, and training it on the training dataset.

2)Making predictions on the training and testing datasets using the trained model.

3)Printing the training and testing accuracy scores of the model.

4)Making predictions on the features of the testing dataset (Y) and displaying the "prognosis" and "predicted" columns.

Conclusion:-

The RandomForestClassifier model has been trained and tested for disease prognosis prediction based on the given symptoms, achieving a certain testing accuracy. The predictions for the test dataset have been obtained and displayed, allowing for an assessment of the model's performance.The provided code appears to be a machine learning project using a RandomForestClassifier to predict disease prognosis based on symptoms. The model is trained on the training dataset, and predictions are made on the testing dataset. The testing accuracy is then printed
